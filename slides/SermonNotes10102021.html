<span class="tag">Romans 7:6</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Our lives are a Christ-like fragrance rising up to God . . . we are a life-giving perfume.</span>

<span class="text">“So now you . . . are not visitors or strangers. Now you are citizens together with God’s holy people. You belong to God’s family”.</span>

<span class="point">Reasons why we need to belong to the Church</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Because we need the regular support and encouragement of Christian fellowship</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters. Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>13</sup>You must warn each other every day, while it is still “today,” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God</span>
<span class="tag">Hebrews 3:12-13 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>25</sup>And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.</span>
<span class="tag">Hebrews 10:24-25 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts.</span>
<span class="tag">Colossians 3:16 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Because fellowship provided by Christian friends is no substitute for belonging to the Church</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">promote the kind of living that reflects wholesome teaching. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>2</sup>Teach the older men to exercise self-control, to be worthy of respect, and to live wisely. They must have sound faith and be filled with love and patience. </span>
<span class="tag">Titus 2:1-10 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>3</sup>Similarly, teach the older women to live in a way that honors God. They must not slander others or be heavy drinkers. Instead, they should teach others what is good. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>4</sup>These older women must train the younger women to love their husbands and their children, </span>
<span class="tag">Titus 2:1-10 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>5</sup>to live wisely and be pure, to work in their homes, to do good, and to be submissive to their husbands. Then they will not bring shame on the word of God. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>In the same way, encourage the young men to live wisely. </span>
<span class="tag">Titus 2:1-10 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>And you yourself must be an example to them by doing good works of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching ... make the teaching about God our Savior attractive in every way.</span>
<span class="tag">Titus 2:1-10 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Because gifts can only rightly be used by someone who is a member of a congregation</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>5</sup>so it is with Christ’s body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you. </span>
<span class="tag">Romans 12:4-10 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.9 Don’t just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good.10 Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring each other.</span>
<span class="tag">Romans 12:4-10 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>5</sup>There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord. </span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:4-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other. </span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:4-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another the same Spirit gives a message of special knowledge. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>9</sup>The same Spirit gives great faith to another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing. </span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:4-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>10</sup>He gives one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy. He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit. Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages, while another is given the ability to interpret what is being said. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>11</sup>It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have.</span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:4-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">the body has many different parts, not just one part. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>15</sup>If the foot says, “I am not a part of the body because I am not a hand,” that does not make it any less a part of the body. </span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>16</sup>And if the ear says, “I am not part of the body because I am not an eye,” would that make it any less a part of the body? </span>
<span class="text"><sup>17</sup>If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything? </span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>18</sup>But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants it. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>19</sup>How strange a body would be if it had only one part! </span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>20</sup>Yes, there are many parts, but only one body. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>21</sup>The eye can never say to the hand, “I don’t need you.” The head can’t say to the feet, “I don’t need you.”</span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Because God’s basic unit is the church – not the individual</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in His own body on the cross, He broke down the wall of hostility that separated us. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>15</sup>He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations. He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in Himself one new people from the two groups. </span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 2:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>16</sup>Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of His death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>17</sup>He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from Him, and peace to the Jews who were near. </span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 2:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>18</sup>Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>19</sup>So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens along with all of God’s holy people. You are members of God’s family. </span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 2:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>20</sup>Together, we are his house, built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus Himself. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>21</sup>We are carefully joined together in Him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.</span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 2:14-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Because - without the Church - we are not truly following Christ</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">All of you together are Christ’s body, and each of you is a part of it.</span>
<span class="tag">1 Corinthians 12:27 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people, and officials flaunt their authority over those under them. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>43</sup>But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant, </span>
<span class="tag">Mark 10:42-45 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>44</sup>and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of everyone else. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>45</sup>For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span>
<span class="tag">Mark 10:42-45 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.</span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 5:21 (ESV)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Because basic maturity in faith and knowledge is found in the Church</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">I left you on the island of Crete so you could complete our work there ...</span>
<span class="tag">Titus 1:5 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Obey your spiritual leaders, and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls, and they are accountable to God. Give them reason to do this with joy and not with sorrow. That would certainly not be for your benefit.</span>
<span class="tag">Hebrews 13: 17 NLT</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>21</sup>Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever! Amen.</span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 3:20-21 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>17</sup>Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong. </span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 3:16-19 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>18</sup>And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>19</sup>May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God.</span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 3:16-19 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">equip God’s people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>13</sup>This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God’s Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. </span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 4:12-16 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>14</sup>Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won’t be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>15</sup>Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church. </span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 4:12-16 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>16</sup>He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.</span>
<span class="tag">Ephesians 4:12-16 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Because listening to sermons online is no substitute for receiving God’s words in the Church you belong to</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">But you, Timothy, certainly know what I teach, and how I live, and what my purpose in life is. You know my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>11</sup>You know how much persecution and suffering I have endured. You know all about how ... the Lord rescued me from all of it.</span>
<span class="tag">2 Timothy 3:10-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />
 
<span class="text">So guard yourselves and God’s people. Feed and shepherd God’s flock—His church, purchased with His own blood ... </span>

<span class="point">Belonging – Conclusion</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Confuses Christians</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Jesus asked, “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?” </span>
<span class="text"><sup>49</sup>Then he pointed to his disciples and said, “Look, these are my mother and brothers. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>50</sup>Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother!”</span>
<span class="tag">Matthew 12:48-50 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">“If you love your father or mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being mine. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>38</sup>If you refuse to take up your cross and follow me, you are not worthy of being mine. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>39</sup>If you cling to your life, you will lose it; but if you give up your life for me, you will find it.</span>
<span class="tag">Matthew 10:37-39 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Confuses non-Christians</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">... you will perish ... unless you repent of your sins and turn to God ... and I tell you again that unless you repent, you will perish, too.”</span>
<span class="tag">Luke 13:3-5 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="point">Fundamentally redefines the local Church</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! </span>
<span class="text"><sup>17</sup>This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!</span>
<span class="tag">2 Corinthians 5:16-17 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>4</sup>If someone claims, “I know God,” but doesn’t obey God’s commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>5</sup>But those who obey God’s word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him.</span>
<span class="tag">1 John 2:3-5 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>2</sup>Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.</span>
