Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
Ephesians 5:25

I promised you as a pure bride to one husband—Christ.
3But I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted, just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent.
4You happily put up with whatever anyone tells you, even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach, or a different kind of Spirit than the one you received, or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed.
2 Corinthians 11:2-4 (NLT)

John replied, “No one can receive anything unless God gives it from heaven.
28You yourselves know how plainly I told you, ‘I am not the Messiah. I am only here to prepare the way for him.’
29It is the bridegroom who marries the bride, and the best man is simply glad to stand with him and hear his vows. Therefore, I am filled with joy at his success.
30He must become greater and greater, and I must become less and less.
31“He has come from above and is greater than anyone else. We are of the earth, and we speak of earthly things, but he has come from heaven and is greater than anyone else. 
32He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but how few believe what he tells them! 
John 3:27-32

One day the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus and asked him, “Why don’t your disciples fast like we do and the Pharisees do?”
15Jesus replied, “Do wedding guests mourn while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
Matthew 9:14-15 (NLT)

Then I heard again what sounded like the shout of a vast crowd or the roar of mighty ocean waves or the crash of loud thunder: “Praise the LORD! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.
7Let us be glad and rejoice, and let us give honor to him. For the time has come for the wedding feast of the Lamb, and his bride has prepared herself.
8She has been given the finest of pure white linen to wear.” For the fine linen represents the good deeds of God’s holy people. 
9And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.” And he added, “These are true words that come from God.” 
Revelation 19:6-9 (NLT)

“The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
2Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
3The five who were foolish didn’t take enough olive oil for their lamps,
4but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil.
5When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
6“At midnight they were roused by the shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom is coming! Come out and meet him!’
7“All the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps.
8Then the five foolish ones asked the others, ‘Please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.’
9“But the others replied, ‘We don’t have enough for all of us. Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves.’
10“But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked.
11Later, when the other five bridesmaids returned, they stood outside, calling, ‘Lord! Lord! Open the door for us!’
12“But he called back, ‘Believe me, I don’t know you!’
13“So you, too, must keep watch! For you do not know the day or hour of my return.
Matthew 25:1-13 (NLT)

Even though they will make a show of being religious, their religion won't be real.
2 Timothy 3:5 CEV

Light in the Temple
“Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.
21 The lampstand will stand in the Tabernacle, in front of the inner curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant. Aaron and his sons must keep the lamps burning in the LORD’s presence all night. This is a permanent law for the people of Israel, and it must be observed from generation to generation.

1 Samuel 10:1 (NLT)

Honor / Abundance / Prosperity
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
2He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me beside the still waters. 
3He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 
4Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me. 
5Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 
6Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
Psalms 23:1-6 (KJV)

Joy
You love justice and hate evil. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy on you
Psalms 45:7 (NLT)

Joy
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. 
Isaiah 61:3 (KJV)

Food / Sustenance
"As surely as the LORD your God lives," she replied, "I don't have any bread--only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it--and die."

Correction
Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness; let him rebuke me—it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. 
Psalms 141:5 (ESV)

Judgment
After the cutting locusts finished eating the crops, the swarming locusts took what was left! After them came the hopping locusts, and then the stripping locusts, too ... 
The fields are ruined, the land is stripped bare. The grain is destroyed, the grapes have shriveled, and the olive oil is gone. 
11Despair ... Wail ... Weep ... all the crops of the field—are ruined ... And the people’s joy has dried up with them ... 
Announce a time of fasting; call the people together for a solemn meeting. Bring the leaders and all the people of the land into the Temple of the LORD your God, and cry out to him there.
15The day of the LORD is near, the day when destruction comes from the Almighty. How terrible that day will be! 
Joel 1:4;10-15 (NLT)

Forgiveness
You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head, but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume. 
47“I tell you, her sins—and they are many—have been forgiven, so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love.” 
48Then Jesus said to the woman, “Your sins are forgiven.”
Luke 7:46-48 (NLT)

Unity – How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity! 2 It is like precious oil poured on the head . . . running down on Aaron’s beard, down on the collar of his robe . . . For there the LORD bestows his blessing, even life forevermore. Psalm 133:1-3 NIV

Healing – Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises.14 Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord.15 Such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make you well. And if you have committed any sins, you will be forgiven. James 5:13-15 (NLT)

“Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the man, he felt compassion for him.34 Going over to him, the Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him. Luke 10:33-34 (NLT)

Spirit – . . . two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? 13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be?

If I do go away, then I will send him to you.8 And when he comes, he will convict the world of its sin, and of God’s righteousness, and of the coming judgment.9 The world’s sin is that it refuses to believe in me.10 Righteousness is available because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more.11 Judgment will come because the ruler of this world has already been judged.12 “There is so much more I want to tell you, but you can’t bear it now.13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth.
