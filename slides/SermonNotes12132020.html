This Week: Disappointment
defeat or failure of expectation or hope: a miscarriage of design or plan

What have you been hoping for?

... disappointment leaves you heartsick.
Proverbs 13:12 TM

Delayed hope makes the heart sick ... 
Proverbs 13:12 HCSB

And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with His love.
Romans 5:5 (NLT)

<sup>6</sup>When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners. 
<sup>7</sup>Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good. 
<sup>8</sup>But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.
Romans 5:6-8 (NLT)

Love
<sup>37</sup>When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. 
Luke 7:37-38 (NLT)

Love
<sup>38</sup>Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair.
Luke 7:37-38 (NLT)

Now that you know these things, God will bless you for doing them.
John 13:17 (NLT)

The LORD is close to those who have suffered disappointment. He saves those who are discouraged.
Psalm 34:18 ERV
