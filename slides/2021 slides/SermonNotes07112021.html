God’s patience with __________________
Jesus answered, “O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you?
Matthew 17:17 (ESV)

The Lord is compassionate and merciful, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. 
9 He will not constantly accuse us, nor remain angry forever.
10 He does not punish us for all our sins; he does not deal harshly with us, as we deserve. 
11 For his unfailing love toward those who fear him is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth. 
12 He has removed our sins as far from us as the east is from the west. 
13 The Lord is like a father to his children, tender and compassionate to those who fear him. 
14 For he knows how weak we are; he remembers we are only dust. 
15 Our days on earth are like grass; like wildflowers, we bloom and die. 
16 The wind blows, and we are gone— as though we had never been here. 
17 But the love of the Lord remains forever with those who fear him. His salvation extends to the children’s children
Psalms 103:8-17 (NLT)

God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal life.17 All honor and glory to God forever and ever!
1 Timothy 1:16-17 (NLT)

Patience with people
Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other’s faults because of your love

And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted people who hear God’s word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge harvest.
Luke 8:15 (NLT) 

So let’s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up. 
10 Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone—especially to those in the family of faith.
Galatians 6:9-10 (NLT) 

Patience in leadership
Again I say, don’t get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights. 
24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people. 
25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people’s hearts, and they will learn the truth.
2 Timothy 2:23-25 (NLT)

26 And the Holy Spirit helps us...
Romans 8:24-26 (NLT) 

Dear brothers and sisters, be patient as you wait for the Lord’s return. Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the rains in the fall and in the spring. They eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen.

James 5:7-8 (NLT) 

The Lord isn’t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.

2 Peter 3:9-10 (NLT)
