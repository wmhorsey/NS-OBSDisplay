<span class="text">As Jesus and the disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the town of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead. <sup>2</sup>“Go into the village over there,” he said. “As soon as you enter it, you will see a donkey tied there, with its colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me. <sup>3</sup>If anyone asks what you are doing, just say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will immediately let you take them.” <sup>4</sup>This took place to fulfill the prophecy that said, <sup>5</sup>“Tell the people of Israel, ‘Look, your King is coming to you. He is humble, riding on a donkey— riding on a donkey’s colt.’” <sup>6</sup>The two disciples did as Jesus commanded. <sup>7</sup>They brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt, and he sat on it. <sup>8</sup>Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. <sup>9</sup>Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting, “Praise God for the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the LORD! Praise God in highest heaven!” <sup>10</sup>The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered. “Who is this?” they asked. <sup>11</sup>And the crowds replied, “It’s Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” </span>

<span class="text">After this I saw a vast crowd, too great to count, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing in front of the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes and held palm branches in their hands. <sup>10</sup>And they were shouting with a mighty shout,  “Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throne and from the Lamb!”</span>
<span class="text-tag">Revelation 7:9-10 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Open for me the gates where the righteous enter, and I will go in and thank the LORD. <sup>20</sup>These gates lead to the presence of the LORD, and the godly enter there. <sup>21</sup>I thank you for answering my prayer and giving me victory! <sup>22</sup>The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone. <sup>23</sup>This is the LORD’s doing, and it is wonderful to see. <sup>24</sup>This is the day the LORD has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. <sup>25</sup>Please, LORD, please save us. Please, LORD, please give us success. <sup>26</sup>Bless the one who comes in the name of the LORD. We bless you from the house of the LORD. <sup>27</sup>The LORD is God, shining upon us. Take the sacrifice and bind it with cords on the altar. <sup>28</sup>You are my God, and I will praise you! You are my God, and I will exalt you! <sup>29</sup>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good! His faithful love endures forever.</span>

<span class="text">“Lord, teach us to pray <sup>2</sup>Jesus said, “This is how you should pray: “Father, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon. <sup>3</sup>Give us each day the food we need, <sup>4</sup>and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. And don’t let us yield to temptation.” <sup>5</sup>Then, teaching them more about prayer, he used this story: “Suppose you went to a friend’s house at midnight, wanting to borrow three loaves of bread. You say to him, <sup>6</sup>‘A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit, and I have nothing for him to eat.’ <sup>7</sup>And suppose he calls out from his bedroom, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is locked for the night, and my family and I are all in bed. I can’t help you.’ <sup>8</sup>But I tell you this—though he won’t do it for friendship’s sake, if you keep knocking long enough, he will get up and give you whatever you need – because of your <strong>shameless</strong> persistence. <sup>9</sup>“And so I tell you, keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you. <sup>10</sup>For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened. <sup>11</sup>“You fathers—if your children ask for a fish, do you give them a snake instead? <sup>12</sup>Or if they ask for an egg, do you give them a scorpion? Of course not! <sup>13</sup>So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.”</span>
