<span class="text-point"><u>How</u> do we get to Living Forward?</span><end-slide />

<span class="text-point">By the <u>Spirit</u> not the flesh</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">For we who worship by the Spirit of God ... rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort,</span>
<span class="tag">Philippians 3:3 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>5</sup>I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin—a real Hebrew if there ever was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.</span>
<span class="tag">Philippians 3:4-6 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ </span>

<span class="text">I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>12</sup>I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>13</sup>For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength.</span>
<span class="tag">Philippians 4:11-13 (NLT)</span><end-slide />
