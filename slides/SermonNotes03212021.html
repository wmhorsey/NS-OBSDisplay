<span class="text-point">Lie #1: <u>God</u> doesn’t need me</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">“He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Since he is Lord of heaven and earth, he doesn’t live in man-made temples, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>25</sup>and human hands can’t serve his needs—for he has no needs. He himself gives life and breath to everything, and he satisfies every need.</span>
<span class="text-tag">Acts 17:24-25 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for all the world is mine and everything in it.</span>

<span class="text">And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>19</sup>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: </span>
<span class="text"><sup>20</sup>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</span>
<span class="text-tag">Matthew 28:18-20 (KJV)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text-point">God allows us to help Him for <u>our</u> good & the good of <u>others</u></span><end-slide />

<span class="text">A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.</span>
<span class="text-tag">1 Corinthians 12:7 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body... and God has put each part just where he wants it.</span>
<span class="text-tag">1 Corinthians 12:12 & 18 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">All of you together are Christ’s body, and each of you is a part of it.</span>

<span class="text-tag">Ephesians 4:16 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text-point">Lie #3: I am too <u>busy</u></span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Trust in the LORD with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.</span>
<span class="text-tag">Proverbs 3:5-6 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">“No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other... </span>

<span class="text">Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? ... </span>
<span class="text-tag">Matthew 6:24-33 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, He will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith? </span>
<span class="text"><sup>31</sup>“So don’t worry about these things, saying, ‘What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?’ </span>
<span class="text-tag">Matthew 6:24-33 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>32</sup>These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs.</span>
<span class="text"><sup>33</sup>Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and He will give you everything you need.</span>
<span class="text-tag">Matthew 6:24-33 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>2</sup>Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.</span>
<span class="text-tag">Romans 12:1-2 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text-point">Lie #4: Serving doesn’t have to take place on <u>Sunday</u> or <u>Wednesday</u></span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>24</sup>Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward, and that the Master you are serving is Christ.</span>
<span class="text-tag">Colossians 3:23-24 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death? </span>
<span class="text"><sup>4</sup>For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives.</span>
<span class="text-tag">Romans 6:3-4 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin. </span>
<span class="text-tag">Romans 6:5-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>9</sup>We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him. </span>
<span class="text-tag">Romans 6:5-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>10</sup>When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>11</sup>So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="text-point">Baptism is a part of our <u>commissioning</u></span><end-slide />

<span class="text">While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior regions until he reached Ephesus, on the coast, where he found several believers. </span>

<span class="text">One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus Himself was baptized. As He was praying, the heavens opened, </span>
