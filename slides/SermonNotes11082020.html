Northshore Fellowship-The Next Steps-EQUIP / Ready for the Lord’s Return-November 8, 2020

“The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 
2Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 
3The five who were foolish didn’t take enough olive oil for their lamps, 
4but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil. 
5When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. 
6“At midnight they were roused by the shout, ‘Look, the bridegroom is coming! Come out and meet him!’ 
7“All the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps. 
8Then the five foolish ones asked the others, ‘Please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.’ 
9“But the others replied, ‘We don’t have enough for all of us. Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves.’ 
10“But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked. 
11Later, when the other five bridesmaids returned, they stood outside, calling, ‘Lord! Lord! Open the door for us!’ 
12“But he called back, ‘Believe me, I don’t know you!’ 
13“So you, too, must keep watch! For you do not know the day or hour of my return.
Matthew 25:1-13 (NLT)

Divine Delay

Most importantly, I want to remind you that in the last days scoffers will come, mocking the truth and following their own desires. 
4They will say, “What happened to the promise that Jesus is coming again? From before the times of our ancestors, everything has remained the same since the world was first created.”
2 Peter 3:3-4 (NLT)

But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day. 
9The Lord isn’t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.
2 Peter 3:8-9 (NLT)

Dear brothers and sisters, be patient as you wait for the Lord’s return. Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the rains in the fall and in the spring. They eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen. 
8You, too, must be patient. Take courage, for the coming of the Lord is near.
James 5:7-8 (NLT)

And it shall come to pass ... that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh;
Joel 2:28 (KJV)

No, what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet Joel: 
17‘In the last days,’ God says, ‘I will pour out my Spirit upon all people.
Acts 2:16-17 (NLT)

He will send the rains in their proper seasons—the early and late rains—so you can bring in your harvests
Deuteronomy 11:14 (NLT)

Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain;
Zechariah 10:1 (KJV)

Regular Sleep

When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
Matthew 25:5 (NLT)

Does God Sleep?

The One who watches over you will not slumber.4 Indeed, He who watches over ... never slumbers or sleeps. 
5The LORD Himself watches over you!
Psalms 121:3-5 (NLT)

When we drift away from the Lord

Wake up, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Get up! Do not reject us forever. 
24Why do you look the other way? Why do you ignore our suffering and oppression?
Psalms 44:23-24 (NLT)

Laziness

Don’t put it off; do it now! Don’t rest until you do. 
5Save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter, like a bird fleeing from a net. 
6Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones. Learn from their ways and become wise! 
7Though they have no prince or governor or ruler to make them work, 
8they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter. 
9But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep? When will you wake up? 
10A little extra sleep, a little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest— 
11then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.
Proverbs 6:4-11 (NLT)

Judgment

I will prepare a different kind of feast for them. I will make them drink until they fall asleep, and they will never wake up again,” says the LORD.
Jeremiah 51:39 (NLT)

Apathy/Urgency

This is all the more urgent, for you know how late it is; time is running out. Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans 13:11 (NLT)

Living In Darkness vs. Light

The light makes everything visible. This is why it is said, “Awake, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will give you light.”
Ephesians 5:14 (NLT)

Being Unprepared

You, too, must keep watch! For you don’t know when the master of the household will return—in the evening, at midnight, before dawn, or at daybreak.
36Don’t let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning.
Mark 13:35-36 (NLT)

False Sense of Security

When people are saying, “Everything is peaceful and secure,” then disaster will fall on them as suddenly as a pregnant woman’s labor pains begin. And there will be no escape.4 But you aren’t in the dark about these things, dear brothers and sisters, and you won’t be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief. 5 For you are all children of the light and of the day; we don’t belong to darkness and night.6 So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded.
1 Thessalonians 5:3-6 (NLT)

Death

Then he said, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but now I will go and wake him up.” 
12The disciples said, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will soon get better!” 
13They thought Jesus meant Lazarus was simply sleeping, but Jesus meant Lazarus had died.
John 11:11-13 (NLT)

Christ Jesus

But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
1 Corinthians 15:20 (ESV)

Resurrection

For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4:14 (ESV)

We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 
52In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians 15:51-52 (KJV)

Unless the LORD builds a house, the work of the builders is wasted. Unless the LORD protects a city, guarding it with sentries will do no good. 
2It is useless for you to work so hard from early morning until late at night, anxiously working for food to eat; for God gives rest to his loved ones.
Psalms 127:1-2 (NLT)

As evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s cross to the other side of the lake.” 
36So they took Jesus in the boat and started out, leaving the crowds behind (although other boats followed). 
37But soon a fierce storm came up. High waves were breaking into the boat, and it began to fill with water. 
38Jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to drown?” 
39When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the water, “Silence! Be still!” Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm. 
40Then he asked them, “Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?”
Mark 4:35-40 (NLT)

... it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, 
22and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
2 Corinthians 1:21-22 (ESV)

I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me, 
29for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else. No one can snatch them from the Father’s hand. 
30The Father and I are one.”
John 10:28-30 (NLT)

In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O LORD, will keep me safe.

When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

“For in just a little while, the Coming One will come and not delay. 
38And my righteous ones will live by faith. But I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away.”
Hebrews 10:37-38 (NLT)
