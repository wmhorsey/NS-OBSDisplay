<span class="text">When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he went into the stronghold. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>18</sup>The Philistines arrived and spread out across the valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>19</sup>So David asked the Lord, “Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?” The Lord replied to David, “Yes, go ahead. I will certainly hand them over to you.”</span>
<span class="text-tag">2 Samuel 5:17-25</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>20</sup>So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. “The Lord did it!” David exclaimed. “He burst through my enemies like a raging flood!” So he named that place Baal-perazim (which means “the Lord who bursts through”). </span>
<span class="text"><sup>21</sup>The Philistines had abandoned their idols there, so David and his men confiscated them.</span>
<span class="text"><sup>22</sup>But after a while the Philistines returned and again spread out across the valley of Rephaim. </span>

<span class="text"><sup>23</sup>And again David asked the Lord what to do. “Do not attack them straight on,” the Lord replied. “Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar trees. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>24</sup>When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, be on the alert! That will be the signal that the Lord is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army.” </span>
<span class="text"><sup>25</sup>So David did what the Lord commanded, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.</span>

<span class="text">Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>Then you will experience God’s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="text">At the moment I have all I need—and more! I am generously supplied with the gifts you sent me with Epaphroditus. They are a sweet-smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>19</sup>And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="text">But David persisted. “I have been taking care of my father’s sheep and goats,” he said. “When a lion or a bear comes to steal a lamb from the flock, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>35</sup>I go after it with a club and rescue the lamb from its mouth. If the animal turns on me, I catch it by the jaw and club it to death. </span>
<span class="text-tag">1 Samuel 17:34-37</span><end-slide />

<span class="text"><sup>36</sup>I have done this to both lions and bears, and I’ll do it to this pagan Philistine, too, for he has defied the armies of the living God! </span>
<span class="text"><sup>37</sup>The Lord who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear will rescue me from this Philistine!”</span>

<span class="text">By his divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life. We have received all of this by coming to know him, the one who called us to himself by means of his marvelous glory and excellence. </span>
