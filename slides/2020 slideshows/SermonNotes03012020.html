<span class='text'>Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God ...</span><span class='tag'>Romans 1:1 NASB</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>But even before I was born, God chose me and called me by his marvelous grace. Then it pleased him <sup>16</sup>to reveal his Son to me so that I would proclaim the Good News about Jesus to the Gentiles.</span><span class='tag'>Galatians 1:15-16 (NLT)</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>Money paid to workers isn't a gift. It is something they earn by working. But you cannot make God accept you because of something you do. God accepts sinners only because they have faith in him.</span><span class='tag'>Romans 4:4-5 CEV</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>And since it is through God’s kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God’s grace would not be what it really is—free and undeserved.</span><span class='tag'>Romans 11:6 (NLT)</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>Everything depends on having faith in God, so that God's promise is assured by his gift of undeserved grace.</span><span class='tag'>Romans 4:16 (CEV)</span><end-slide />

<span class='text'>through whom we have received grace and apostleship</span><span class='tag'>Romans 1:5 NASB</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</span><span class='tag'>1 Corinthians 15:5 NIV</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'><strong>Grace <u>Produces</u> The <u>Obedience</u> of Faith</strong></span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles ...</span><span class='tag'>Romans 1:5 NASB</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>... Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.</span><span class='tag'>Romans 9:32 HCSB</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.</span><span class='tag'>Romans 14:23 (ESV)</span><end-slide />
<span class='text'><strong>Why?</strong></span><end-slide />
<span class='text'>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for His name’s sake ...</span><span class='tag'>Romans 1:1-5 NASB</span><end-slide />
