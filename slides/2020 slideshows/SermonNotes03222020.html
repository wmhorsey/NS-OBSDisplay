<span class="text">O God, you are my God; I earnestly search for you. My soul thirsts for you; my whole body longs for you in this parched and weary land where there is no water.  
<sup>2</sup>I have seen you in your sanctuary and gazed upon your power and glory. 
<sup>3</sup>Your unfailing love is better than life itself; how I praise you! 
<sup>4</sup>I will praise you as long as I live, lifting up my hands to you in prayer. 
<sup>5</sup>You satisfy me more than the richest feast. I will praise you with songs of joy.  
<sup>6</sup>I lie awake thinking of you, meditating on you through the night.  
<sup>7</sup>Because you are my helper, I sing for joy in the shadow of your wings.  
<sup>8</sup>I cling to you; your strong right hand holds me securely.  
<sup>9</sup>But those plotting to destroy me will come to ruin.  
<sup>11</sup>... All who trust in him will praise him ...</span>
