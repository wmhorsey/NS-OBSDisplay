<span class="text">“When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are about to enter and occupy, he will clear away many nations ahead of you: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. These seven nations are greater and more numerous than you.</span>
<span class="text"><sup>2</sup>When the LORD your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaties with them and show them no mercy.</span>
<span class="text"><sup>3</sup>You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters,</span>
<span class="text"><sup>4</sup>for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods.</span>

<span class="text">Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit. <sup>6</sup>So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death.

<span class="text"><strong>ILUSTRATION</strong> – There was an auction one day of the books and furniture of a very celebrated author, and a vain but rich young man, having induced the auctioneer to offer them in one lot, paid several thousand pounds for the books, shelves, carpet, and in fact everything except the room itself. He directed the things to be taken carefully to his house and fitted up in a room, and placed in the same positions as in the author’s study. The young man then sat down with reverence on the author’s chair, took up the author’s pen, dipped it in the author’s ink, and bent his head over the paper on the author’s table. But nothing came; the paper remained a blank. The genius of the author was in neither his pen nor his surrounding, but in his spirit--the gift of God. We may be unable to create in our spirit the genius of a celebrated man; but we may develop our own faculty; and, if we do this, we shall bless the world exactly as God wishes us to do. The little forget-me-nots which grow in the quiet nook of the steep rock do their work as effectively as the great oaks which grace the park of a king; and as the tiny flower does its best, it is as worthy of praise as the gigantic tree that does no more.</span><end-slide />

<span class="text-point">But Paul was not copying anyone.</span>

<span class="text">At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! <sup>17</sup>This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!</span>

<span class="text">When Paul loved the Lord this way – The Holy Spirit was able to lead & control Paul</span><end-slide />
<span class="text">Next Paul and Silas traveled through the area of Phrygia and Galatia, because the Holy Spirit had prevented them from preaching the word in the province of Asia at that time.</span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>Then coming to the borders of Mysia, they headed north for the province of Bithynia, but again the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go there.</span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>So instead, they went on through Mysia to the seaport of Troas.</span>
