<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>They trust in their wealth and boast of great riches. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>Yet they cannot redeem themselves from death by paying a ransom to God. </span>

<span class="text">For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised. We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>4</sup>though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could... </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done. </span>

<span class="text"><strong>Believing in the earth</strong></span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Most importantly, I want to remind you that in the last days scoffers will come, mocking the truth... </span>
<span class="text"><sup>5</sup>They deliberately forget that God made the heavens by the word of his command... </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>And by the same word, the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire. They are being kept for the day of judgment, when ungodly people will be destroyed. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends: A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>9</sup>The Lord isn’t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>10</sup>But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>11</sup>Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>12</sup>looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>13</sup>But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God’s righteousness. </span>

<span class="text">“Why did the LORD allow us to be defeated by the Philistines?” Then they said, “Let’s bring the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD from Shiloh. If we carry it into battle with us, it will save us from our enemies.” </span>
<span class="text-tag">1 Samuel 4:3 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: </span>
<span class="text"><sup>24</sup>And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. </span>
<span class="text-tag">Psalms 139:23-24 (KJV)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">So they sent men to Shiloh to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies... </span>
<span class="text"><sup>5</sup>When all the Israelites saw the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD coming into the camp, their shout of joy was so loud it made the ground shake! </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>“What’s going on?” the Philistines asked. “What’s all the shouting about in the Hebrew camp?” When they were told it was because the Ark of the LORD had arrived, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>they panicked. “The gods have come into their camp!” they cried. “This is a disaster! We have never had to face anything like this before! </span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>Help! Who can save us from these mighty gods of Israel? They are the same gods who destroyed the Egyptians with plagues when Israel was in the wilderness. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>9</sup>Fight as never before, Philistines! If you don’t, we will become the Hebrews’ slaves just as they have been ours! Stand up like men and fight!” </span>
<span class="text"><sup>10</sup>So the Philistines fought desperately, and Israel was defeated again. The slaughter was great; 30,000 Israelite soldiers died that day. The survivors turned and fled to their tents. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>11</sup>The Ark of God was captured, and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were killed. </span>

<span class="text">A group of Jews was traveling from town to town casting out evil spirits. They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus in their incantation, saying, “I command you in the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, to come out!” </span>
<span class="text"><sup>14</sup>Seven sons of Sceva, a leading priest, were doing this. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>15</sup>But one time when they tried it, the evil spirit replied, “I know Jesus, and I know Paul, but who are you?” </span>
<span class="text"><sup>16</sup>Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, overpowered them, and attacked them with such violence that they fled from the house, naked and battered. </span>
<span class="text-tag">Acts 19:13-16 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">The story of what happened spread quickly all through Ephesus, to Jews and Greeks alike. A solemn fear descended on the city, and the name of the Lord Jesus was greatly honored. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>18</sup>Many who became believers confessed their sinful practices. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>19</sup>A number of them who had been practicing sorcery brought their incantation books and burned them at a public bonfire. The value of the books was several million dollars. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>20</sup>So the message about the Lord spread widely and had a powerful effect. </span>

<span class="text">One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, “<span class="rL">Let us go across to the other side of the lake.</span>” So they set out, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>23</sup>and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>24</sup>And they went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm. </span>
