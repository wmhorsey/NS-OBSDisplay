Let them be a living and holy sacrifice—the kind he will find acceptable.

As the two of them walked on together,  <sup>7</sup>Isaac turned to Abraham and said, “Father?” “Yes, my son?” Abraham replied. “We have the fire and the wood,” the boy said, “but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?”  <sup>8</sup>“God will provide a sheep for the burnt offering, my son,” Abraham answered. And they both walked on together.</span><span class="tag">Genesis 22:6-8 (NLT)</span><end-slide />God’s Response / Answer To Worship<end-slide /><span class="text">When they arrived at the place where God had told him to go, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied his son, Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.  <sup>10</sup>And Abraham picked up the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice.  <sup>11</sup>At that moment the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Yes,” Abraham replied. “Here I am!”  <sup>12</sup>“Don’t lay a hand on the boy!” the angel said. “Do not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God. You have not withheld from me even your son, your only son.”</span><span class="tag">Genesis 22:9-12 (NLT)</span><end-slide /><span class="text">Then Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering in place of his son.  <sup>14</sup>Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means “the Lord will provide”). To this day, people still use that name as a proverb: “On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.”  <sup>15</sup>Then the angel of the Lord called again to Abraham from heaven.  <sup>16</sup>“This is what the Lord says: Because you have obeyed me and have not withheld even your son, your only son, I swear by my own name that  <sup>17</sup>I will certainly bless you. I will multiply your descendants beyond number, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies.  <sup>18</sup>And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed—all because you have obeyed me.”</span><span class="tag">Genesis 22:13-18 (NLT)</span><end-slide />Communion<end-slide />Source<end-slide /><span class="text">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <sup>17</sup>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</span><span class="tag">John 3:16-17 (KJV)</span><end-slide />Submission / Obedience<end-slide /><span class="text">Though he was God, he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to.  <sup>7</sup>Instead, he gave up his divine privileges; he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form,  <sup>8</sup>he humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal’s death on a cross.</span><span class="tag">Philippians 2:6-8 (NLT)</span><end-slide />Separation<end-slide /><span class="text">And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”</span><span class="tag">Matthew 26:39 (ESV)</span><end-slide /><span class="text">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <sup>24</sup>And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span><span class="tag">1 Corinthians 11:23-24 (KJV)</span><end-slide />Sacrifice<end-slide /><span class="text">With his own blood—not the blood of goats and calves—he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever . . .
