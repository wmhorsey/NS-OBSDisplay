<span class="text">And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>35</sup>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>36</sup>For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? </span>
<span class="text"><sup>37</sup>For what can a man give in return for his soul? </span>
<span class="text"><sup>38</sup>For whoever is <strong>ashamed</strong> of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be <strong>ashamed</strong> when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” </span>

<span class="text">The disciples were astounded. “Then who in the world can be saved?” they asked. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>26</sup>Jesus looked at them intently and said, “Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But with God everything is possible.” </span>

<span class="text">This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!</span> 
<span class="text-tag">2 Corinthians 5:17 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to sinful desires. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>13</sup>Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin. Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God. </span>
<span class="text-tag">Romans 6:12-13 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don’t be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behavior, slander, and dirty language. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>9</sup>Don’t lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>10</sup>Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>11</sup>In this new life, it doesn’t matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbaric, uncivilized, slave, or free. Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us. </span>
<span class="text-tag">Colossians 3:5-11 (NLT)</span><end-slide />

<span class="text">Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him, </span>
<span class="text"><sup>22</sup>throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>23</sup>Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>24</sup>Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy. </span>

<span class="text">I came to you in weakness—timid and trembling. </span>

<span class="text">Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>6</sup>We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>7</sup>For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>8</sup>And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>9</sup>We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>10</sup>When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God. </span>
<span class="text"><sup>11</sup>So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus. </span>
